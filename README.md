-SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
If you want to play “Artemis Journey” you will need to install the graphical engine “Unity” (Version 20.3.19F1 or earlier).
When we'll upload the game on a web source you will just need to open it by an internet browser.

-GAME INFOS:
Into the game, long loading times may occur because of high dimension assets, like: Moon/Mars real size terrain, lander's 3D model and so much particles effects.
At the moment is available as location only the Moon, but going on with the development lots of new planets and lander are going to be developed.

-GAME PURPOSE:
The 3D interactive videogame, Artemis'Journey will manage you to simulate a "realistic" landing, but watch out about troubles like asteroids, spiky lunar hills and don't forget to administer your fuel to arrive safely at your destination. Game's missions will permit you to deliver the necessary equipment, explore the surface and plant your team flag to delimitate your future moon colony. Firstly the moon... then Mars... then what else? Let's simulate how to approach new planets: from landing correctly, to improve Human's universal knowledge. 
Playing this game will teach you how space missions are planned and how to approach them.

-GAME SUMMARY:
Watch out at the planet ground, not everywhere is safe! If you hit it while speeding, you will destroy your spaceship! There could be some asteroids in space, so be careful that can damage your space shuttle. If you choose of exploring Moon don’t forget to turn on your rockets because the lunar gravity will attract you! And if you land alive on the moon, you can also put a flag in the ground!

-GAME COMMANDS:
To manage how to land your space ship these are the commands/keywords:

-	(W or Up_Arrow) = Moving to up direction - contrast imminent falling;
-	(S or Down_Arrow) = Slow down (You will use much more fuel to get slower);
-	(D e A or Left_Arrow e Right_Arrow) Tilt and slide to left or right;
-	(Shift + D e A or Left_Arrow e Right_Arrow) = Just tilt left or right (It doesn't slide);
-	(Spacebar) = TURBO;

ATTENTION: The lander will INDIPENDENTLY move on its forward. You'll need to be able to slow its movement when it'll be necessary.
